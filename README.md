# Voice-Assistant-Java
Voice Assistant which has been implemented using Java’s Maven. Where the functions are based on the voice input of the user where every vocal input defines the functionality of the assistant. Commands are programmed to perform certain tasks like opening certain applications or to perform certain sub-tasks using software or application. The code includes JRE system library files, JDK system library files and the Maven dependencies which is in the name of the file pom.xml. It also needs Sphinx libraries to do the task. Sphinx4 is a pure Java speech recognition library. It provides a quick and easy API to convert the speech recordings into text with the help of CMUSphinx acoustic models. It can be used on servers and in desktop applications. The code combines all the libraries to give the output which is the execution of specified commands. Hence this is how the program’s function and output can be expected. Hence once creating the complete maven project one can call the dependencies and set up all the dictionary commands and the language models (both language models and dictionary file can be generated by providing the simple command.txt file into the SPHINX knowledge base generator) later all those files will help for process of the voice commands which we are about to provide for our assitant hence once completing all these tasks we are good to go to run our program.
